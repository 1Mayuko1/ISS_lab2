Well, she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her,
She wouldn't dance with another
When I saw her standing there
